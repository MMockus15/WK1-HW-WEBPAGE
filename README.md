# Discription: 
Week 1 challenge I did a code refactor for Horeseon. In this challenge I removed the divs and added in sections to make the html code more user friendly. In css sytle sheet, I combined like codes and changed the main classes to reflect the same code in each section. I simplified the css style sheet to be condensed into a more concise sheet. To finish the project I took a png screen shot using GoFullPage and attached it to the README file.
